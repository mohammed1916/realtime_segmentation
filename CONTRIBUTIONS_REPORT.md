The video processing system supports multiple input sources including direct video file processing, real-time camera feed integration, and continuous frame-by-frame stream processing. The implementation features automatic detection and handling of input dimensions, preservation of original video timing, and flexible output format support for various deployment scenarios.

#### 3.1.2 Processing Pipeline

The end-to-end video processing workflow begins with efficient frame extraction from video streams, followed by RGB conversion and normalization preprocessing. The optimized SegFormer model then performs inference prediction, with subsequent post-processing for segmentation mask generation. Real-time overlay rendering enables immediate visualization, while video writing capabilities ensure high-quality output with segmentation results.

### 3.2 Temporal Logit Smoothing

#### 3.2.1 Smoothing Algorithm

The temporal smoothing algorithm utilizes a configurable smoothing factor (α) ranging from 0 to 1 for temporal blending, with a default value of 0.6 that provides optimal balance between responsiveness and stability. The approach incorporates efficient memory management for storing previous frame logits, ensuring minimal computational overhead during real-time processing.

#### 3.2.2 Benefits and Applications

The temporal smoothing technique eliminates temporal noise in segmentation masks, enhances prediction consistency across similar frames, and improves visual quality through smoother transitions in video output, all while maintaining minimal computational overhead for real-time processing. This approach finds applications in autonomous driving for stable lane and object detection, video surveillance for consistent tracking of moving objects, medical imaging for smooth segmentation in video sequences, and AR/VR applications for stable overlay rendering.

   \end{equation}

4. **Parameter Update with Decoupled Weight Decay:**
